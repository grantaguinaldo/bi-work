# BI Assignments

In this README file, I'd like to highlight a few things.

First, for Assignment 2, I solved this problem using both Python and SAS. The PDF of the SAS solution can be viewed from this [link](https://github.com/grantaguinaldo/bi-work/blob/main/bi-work-assignment-02-sas-solution.pdf). The SAS code that I developed for this Assignment can be viewed from this [link](https://github.com/grantaguinaldo/bi-work/blob/main/bi-work-assignment-02-sas-solution.sas).

Second, for Assignment 3, I solved this problem using the folium package for Python. The heatmaps cannot be rendered in Github and will need to be shown through the notebook when the Anaconda server is running. The PDF of the solution can be viewed from this [link]. (https://github.com/grantaguinaldo/bi-work/blob/main/bi-work-assignment-03.pdf). The Python code that I developed for this Assignment can be viewed from this [link](https://github.com/grantaguinaldo/bi-work/blob/main/bi-work-assignment-03.ipynb).
