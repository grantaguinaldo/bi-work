# BI Assignments

In this README file, I'd like to highlight a few things.

For **Assignment 1**, I solved this problem using Python. The PDF of the Python solution can be viewed from this [link](https://github.com/grantaguinaldo/bi-work/blob/main/bi-work-assignment-01.pdf). The Python code that I developed for this assignment can be viewed from this [link](https://github.com/grantaguinaldo/bi-work/blob/main/bi-work-assignment-01.ipynb).

For **Assignment 2**, I solved this problem using both Python and SAS. The PDF of the SAS solution can be viewed from this [link](https://github.com/grantaguinaldo/bi-work/blob/main/bi-work-assignment-02-sas-solution.pdf). The SAS code that I developed for this Assignment can be viewed from this [link](https://github.com/grantaguinaldo/bi-work/blob/main/bi-work-assignment-02-sas-solution.sas). The PDF of the Python solution can be viewed from this [link](https://github.com/grantaguinaldo/bi-work/blob/main/bi-work-assignment-01.pdf). The Python code that I developed for this assignment can be viewed from this [link](https://github.com/grantaguinaldo/bi-work/blob/main/bi-work-assignment-02.ipynb)

For **Assignment 3**, I solved this problem using the folium package for Python. The heatmaps cannot be rendered in Github and will need to be shown through the notebook when the Anaconda server is running on my local machine or from the links to the webapp noted below. The PDF of the solution can be viewed from this [link](https://github.com/grantaguinaldo/bi-work/blob/main/bi-work-assignment-03.pdf). The Python code that I developed for this Assignment can be viewed from this [link](https://github.com/grantaguinaldo/bi-work/blob/main/bi-work-assignment-03.ipynb).

To aid in visualizing the heatmaps, I am hosting both maps on a webapp (please wait for upto 30 seconds for the sever to load).
The Response Rates for that are <50% can be viewed at this [link](https://grantaguinaldo-heatmap.herokuapp.com/lower).
The Response Rates for that are >75% can be viewed at this [link](https://grantaguinaldo-heatmap.herokuapp.com/upper).

#### Map of the Response Rates for the <50% Quartiles 
(Compare the response rates in Orange County, Downey and Pico Rivera in this map vs. the lack of activity in the same areas for the >75% Quartile map)
